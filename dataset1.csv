Nivedita Nair,une 2021,5,"My 8 year old daughter and I loved it! Absolute laugh riot! Bought th kindle edition.Great fun book explaining the importance of choice, acceptance and democracy.
"
Kindle Customer,March 2018,1,"That was so sweet! The ending got me.. and the illustrations, omg super cute. I hope to buy the hardcover version some time soon. (Heres a tip -try reading it in John's voice, it just makes it better, especially stuff like ""and this is true""). Not sure if it's great for a very young child - kids don't understand phrases like ""it's a long story"" (my nephew will ask me - why is it a long story? What does that mean?). But I'd definitely recommend reading it to kids who are 8 years and above.
"
Nivedita Nair,une 2021,5,"Although I am from India and this book would not be of any use for us in the country. Our country is too backward and years away from making the civil rights progress for the LGBTQ community, I support the cause. Also, I have a nephew whom I would like to teach inclusion and how to be liberal in social aspects.The book was excellent and made me clap with joy at the ending, seeing democracy actually working. Lovely illustrations we're added bonus.PS: I would support John Oliver in everything he endeavors to do.

Sue,March 2018,5,"Thank you so much, John Oliver. Thank you so much for this. I am a queer woman living in a country which provides negative sanctions to those of us who choose to live and love outside what is considered normative. For every bunny who is different and different will always be special. ❤️

Amazon Customer,March 2018,5,"I read the sample and It was amazing. Although I don't have the money to buy this book, I encourage those that can afford it to buy it and read. Please show your support to those who are alienated by evil people like VP. Good job Mr. Oliver.

Amazon Customer,March 2018,5,"Just read this book to my youngest (was originally purchased for my eldest when she was 6. My youngest is now 5). He absolutely loved it and we talked about love and being different after we read it. Five years after purchase this is the book that keeps on giving great conversation starters with my kids of acceptance, love, and cute little animals.
"
Sahil,April 2018,5,"Side note: you may want to ignore all reviews that do not have “verified purchase” listed on them since it’s quite difficult to write a review on a product you don’t actually have.I found this book to be quite touching. The message is very positive and relevant in the world we live in today. The illustrations are bright and beautiful. As like many children’s movies, there are a few hidden adult references that will get a chuckle but the kids just won’t understand until they’re older. The message is that it’s beautiful to be different, and that’s something that I do want my children to learn at every age. I commend John Oliver for what he’s done and the charities he’s looking to support with sales of this book. I don’t think it takes away from the Pence family’s book at all, since people are just as easily able to purchase that book too. I, personally, felt uncomfortable purchasing the Pence book due to their book tour making a stop at focus on the family. I’m glad Oliver gave us an alternative option that supports all who live around the world, not just the ones who follow what’s always been. Happiness is the goal, not judgement of others, and this book presents that beautifully.
"
Prashant S.,March 2018,5,"I worked with someone who told me that one of the things they had to get across to their children was ""different isn't bad, it's just different"". That the point of the book. That it also pokes fun at Mike Pence is just a bonus that will be lost in children, but one look at the stink bug had me convinced. And the proceeds that would have gone to Last Week Tonight go th charity is a bonus.
"
Kaushik Banerjee,March 2018,5,"As soon as I saw this book on “John Oliver presents”, I knew I had to have a hardback copy – and yesterday it arrived!  This is such a lovely story – for children of all ages, for anyone who has ever felt lonely and / or different, or for those who just love a feel-good story.  The illustrations are just wonderful – anyone would fall in love with Wesley.  With the exception of the Stinkbug, all the characters look and act in an adorable manner (keep a look out for Phil and Dennis!).  They are primarily Friends (with a capital F), who love and support Marlon Bundo, because that is what friends do: “Everyone is different.  And different is not bad. … Different is Special”.  Each of the friends mentions ways in which they are different, so Marlon’s choices mark him out as just as unusual as someone who “reads the end of books before the beginnings”, and not as someone to be shunned or pilloried.  This book is about tolerance, open-mindedness and love – but also has strong lessons about the importance of democracy as a tool for positive change.  May Marlon and Wesley hop together for many, many years to come.
"
APerry,tates on 9 January 2023,5,"This book says it's for ages 6-8, but I have to say, my 2 and 4 year old absolutely Love it!  My 2 year old has been requesting ""Bundo!  Bundo!"" every night for going on two months now; her big brother just love this book and it was his #1 favorite for several months while he was 3 :-)The themes of inclusivity, love, good overcoming bad, having hope, teamwork, caring about one another, and engaging in the democratic process are all touched on so well here!  I seriously had conversations with my son about how the voting process works because of this book - and he (at 3 1/2) was the one who initiated the conversations!I cannot say enough good about the book... it's one of my favorite, as well :-)
"
Nivedita Nair,4 June 2021,5,"My book just arrived after the first publication sold out and I couldn't me more pleased. I'm a 28 year old female living in Wisconsin and I have no children. Yet this book still brought a little tear to my eye while also making chuckle- Dill Prickle the hedgehog was EVERYTHING! It warms hesrt to think of this book being a part of child's life... Being read to them at school or by a parent or guardian or reading alone and getting lost in the little details like I remember doing with books when I was young. Yes, the proceeds going towards an amazing organization is wonderful and nothing makes me happier than being part of a massive collective troll of the VP, but thinking of the potential subtle world changing effects this story could have in the future is the best part. Changing the way a child will precieve LGBTQ+ people as they are growing up is huge, and it is high time for that change to come. This book is a perfect example of how we start making that change. In summation, everyone should buy this book! 10/10 would HIGHLY recommend!

Kate,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 March 2018,5,"The only thing that makes the Kindle version of this better, is buying the audible version with the all-star cast to read it while you do. It's a great addition for only a couple bucks more. As for the story, my headline says it all! If you're against boy bunnies falling in love and wanting to hop together for the rest of their lives, then this book is not for you. Also, if you're against that, you're a very sad, very boring person, frankly. I love this book SO much! Not since And Tango Makes Three have I been so moved by a book about gay animals. There really is a sweet message to be learned here, not just to poke fun at the hateful views of Mike Pence - though admittedly, that's a nice bonus. The illustrations are really cute, the story has some cute callback lines, like other children's books do. Yes, I bought this to support the efforts of a favorite Late Night TV host comedian, but it was seriously worth every penny! Oh... and the audible cast read by the stars truly is worth the extra couple dollars!

nightowl,tates 🇺🇸 on 19 March 2018,5,"I bought this for my twin 6 year old nieces... and I just got this text after they read it the other day... 5 Stars!“Yooo sol and naiya really like this book guys its a hit 4 real...the first thing naiya said when we were done reading it the first time is ' well this book sure teaches us a valuable lesson'...oh yea what's that I said.....'that no one can tell you who to love...even if the one in charge says no they can't decide who you love. Only you can decide that'....(😭my baby)...and then today before they asked to read it again naiya says so how come in fairy tales and princess stories the princess always gets married to the prince or it's always a girl and a boy who fall in love? Sooo times they are changing hallelujah but damn we need more of these all kind of different family structure books 📚  Thanks guys so much they need this in their lives and they love it! pretty soon they'll b able to read it to us ✨”

Rosemary Standeven,ingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 April 2018,5,"Well worth the read even if you're not a child. It does a really good job of showing that differences are a part of life and are wonderful.
"
Lacey,tates 🇺🇸 on 12 June 2020,5,"I bought one for myself and one as a gift. I love this book, the story, characters and illustrations are absolutely charming and I recommend it! Our world needs love and happiness, good messages and books about standing up for yourself, books about bunnies, books about true friends and taking care of each other. My only sadness is that this book is not compatible with iOS so you cannot read on the iPhone or iPad, only on a Mac computer. I hope this changes soon!! No matter, buy the book because the proceeds go to an excellent cause.
"
Elizabeth,tates 🇺🇸 on 28 April 2018,5,"I bought this book as a middle finger to Pence and was happy the proceeds will go to a good cause. It was worth it for that reason alone. But as a great bonus, it's an adorable little story.Even if you are straight as an arrow, even if all your friends are straight as arrows (*especially* if they are), you should read books like this to your kids. When mine were little, I rejigged some of the stories to make them more inclusive. Sometimes friends made fun of me, pointing out that I had a 5% chance of having a gay child, but I always told them that even if I don't have a gay kid, my kids will inevitably have gay friends and I want them growing up in a world where gay might be less common, but it's definitely normal. Two of my kids are straight, and behaved like it was the most normal thing in the world when my youngest came out to them. I wish I'd had this sort of book to read to my incredibly well-adjusted, happy, normal gay 13-year-old when she was small, though. The fact that books like this will be around for her children made me cry all the way through the damn book.I bought the audio version too so I could see the illustrations as I listened, which I definitely recommend.
"
Elizabeth, 13 May 2022,5,"John Oliver melted the bitter winter chill of hatred with this beautiful book, It’s good of him to support rabbit authors who so often struggle with finding collaborators like Jill Twiss who can translate and type for them. Bunny paws are difficult to work on the keyboard.The other Bundk  book is less for children than this one just in terms of art, this book has illustrations with breathtaking color and beauty, it’s a bright and beautiful world full of funny repetitions and hilarious details just for adults. Also, yes it says it’s a children’s book, but it’s listed under Gay Fiction. People who bought the wrong book really don’t pay close attention. Maybe they didn’t pay close attention to who they were electing either. That would explain a lot.If you buy a book which is #1 in Fay fiction maybe give it a try, the Freudian slip might open your heart if you can engage with the narrative without hate. We need more books that demonstrate falling in love without gender restrictions.
"
Jaymee,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 March 2018,5,"This is such a sweet book, and the Audible cast is delightful. I especially liked the hedgehog and the turtle. This is a good book for kids, especially kids who have some LGBT family or who like bunnies and hedgehogs. The pictures are excellent and the text is done in that very matter-of-fact style that is best for little kids who are fairly new to reading. My preschooler quite enjoyed it, especially the turtle and Pajama the cat, and she likes that Marlon Bundo wears a polka-dot bow tie. Scooter the Turtle was her favorite and mine was Dill Prickle the hedgehog. She was a little afraid of the stinkbug, which is odd, she normally likes the real ones and waves goodbye when we put one outside. But people who act like the stinkbug does are scary, and we tell children stories so they can learn how to deal with the villains they will find in real life. In that respect, this is a very good book. I would like a story about Scooter the Turtle and their sparkly shell next, please.

Seattle guy,tates 🇺🇸 on 16 May 2018,5,"This was a last minute replacement gift, so I had no time to exchange. Arrived damaged, either in shipment or sent that way. Was embarrassed to give this. Shame because book and message behind it is awesome.
"
M.V.,tates 🇺🇸 on 13 March 2022,5,"Previous review got deleted.  Not sure why.  I guess it was too political.  Ok so I guess I'll rate it 5 stars this time (instead of 1 to try and just annoy the trolls).  This is a great book for all.  It teaches being inclusive and tolerance, something we could all use more of.  It is a book of LOVE.  As an Evangelical Christian, I am upset that the political arm of the church has preached so much bigotry and hate.  None of that is endorsed by the Bible or Jesus.  We are to love our neighbors as ourselves.I read it to my 2 week old daughter.  She is a better person now.  Highly recommended.
"
LPBJ,tates 🇺🇸 on 19 March 2018,5,"This is great book, well-written and illustrated, adorable, and, of course, progressive.  That it was a best-seller (#1, even) is endearing.  John Oliver's group created this book in response to the Mike Pence book about his rabbit (Marlon Bundo).  John Oliver is a bit in-you-face about progressive issues, and he takes (rightfully so) issue with Pence's stance on gay marriage and homosexuality in general.  All of the proceeds go to charity for at-risk youth (Trevor Foundation).  However, this is a John Oliver product (even if not written by him per se), and it's as in-your-face all all of his other performances.  I'm guessing the target audience for this book is a staunchly liberal one.  Pence's daughter herself, though, bought a copy and said ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and proceeds go to charity, just like our book,"" so she totally took the high road on it. I've purchased 3 copies for the 3 babies randomly cropping up this past year.

Nivedita Nair,22 March 2018,1,"I am now the happiest bunny in Norway! Teaching my awesome nieces not only the English language, but also that it is okay to love someone no matter what kind of gender you are or relate to.And, of course I just love the fact that buying this book supports my fellow queer-family on the other side of the Atlantic!Thank you J. Oliver and of course a big thanks to all supporters of equality and acceptance! I am so glad that your current President (not naming him out of principal reasons, you know like in Harry Potter...) does not represent the majority's view on human rights and other major issues.Please correct that wrong that happened to US (and the rest of the world except Russia and N. Korea) in 2016, get a normal person doing that job and get your act back together. You can not claim to be the protector of democracy with that mad man as the commander and chief!!!
"
Kindle Customer, 19 March 2018,5,"What a charming story, and the illustrations are really well done as well!  I can't wait to share this book with everyone I know, especially my young nieces, nephews, and cousins.  It's a wonderfully well written tale that stands as a reminder in these troubled times that love is still pure and beautiful!To quote Charlie Chaplin: ""Do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed — the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish. You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason.  Let us all unite!""

I gave it to them today, she almost cried when we looked through it cause hormones, I almost cried cause it’s cute and he’s just as happy about it. The drawings are wonderful, the story is amazing and you can almost hear John Oliver’s voice in your head when you read it. Wonderful book, wonderful concept and wonderful idea to donate the proceeds to lgbtq organisations. Would absolutely recommend to anyone who’s heart isn’t made entirely out of stone.

Marja R Dallaire,tates 🇺🇸 on 21 March 2018,5,"Bravo! Last week tonight did it again. Let's hope that the period off turmoil we are facing now will end within our lifetime. If not, the generations of childrens who will be expose to the stories of people differents from them will pick up the slack. Why? Because they will have learn that the easy ways of the past is not what we need to face the real challenges of the future. We will need to take risks and get out of are confort zone to push everybody forward. Unfortunately, people like Mike Pence are unwilling to change and adapt to new situations. They rather pray the problems away, or fight to preserve things the way they are. But at the and of the day we all know that adaptation is survival. So, maybe we should accept people for the way they are if they are not hurting anybody and focus our energy on real issues, that will affect people for generations. Good job, last week!
"
Marja R Dallaire,tates 🇺🇸 on 13 May 2018,5,"This is a heartwarming and entertaining story with a great message. My 5yr old enjoyed reading it with me. Personally, I would've found it more satisfying for the animals to come up with a solution other than voting out the story's villain (civil disobedience, impeachment, etc.) but this *is* a book for kids and the vote was quick and kept the story moving to the happy conclusion. The characters and illustrations are wonderful. This is a real book that works on its own, apart from its place as a satirical response to the Pence family's book.The book seems to be quite in line with the legacy of Marlon Bundo's namesake, who was open about his sexual experiences with other men and who supported civil rights. I do wonder what the Pences were thinking when they chose the bunny's name!I hope the Kindle version becomes available on more devices/apps! I had to download the Kindle app for PC since it wasn't even available on Kindle Cloud Reader.

B. Wong,tates 🇺🇸 on 27 March 2022,5,"Es war für mich sehr beeindruckend, in welch einfacher Art der Autor kleinen Kindern - ohne erhobenen Zeigefinger - das Wesen der Demokratie nahe bringt. ""Stinkekäfer"" oder alle anderen Personen, die der Ansicht sind, dass sie besonders wichtig sind und deshalb ihre Weltsicht als die einzig richtige zu gelten hat, haben anzuerkennen, dass andere das gleiche Recht zur Entfaltung ihrer Persönlichkeit haben. Und wie wichtig Solidarität und Freundschaft im Leben jedes Einzelnen sind.Nur durch den Zusammenhalt der Freunde gegen Intoleranz und Ignoranz kann sich die Liebe durchsetzen und Marlon und Wesley können zu ihrem Bunnymoon aufbrechen. Ich wünsche ihnen das Beste!Bei ""Beste"" fällt mir ein, dass ich die Zeichnungen noch gar nicht erwähnt habe. Tja, ich habe lange überlegt, ob ich damit anfangen sollte. Die liebevoll und aussagekräftig gestalteten Figuren, gehen einem ans Herz. Ich habe das kleine Büchlein als sehr alter Mensch, der weit weg von solcher Art ""Lektüre"" sein sollte, schon mehrfach angeschaut. Immer wieder finde ich neue Details, die mich erfreuen.Alleine deshalb rechtfertigt sich schon der Preis. Was ich aber besonders erfreulich finde, dass der Gewinn an LGBT-Organisationen überwiesen werden soll, was hoffentlich auch geschieht.Es bleibt mir nur noch, dem Team meinen herzlichsten Dank zu sagen und ihnen Erfolg im Kampf gegen Intoleranz und rechte Gesinnung zu wünschen. Es steht viel auf dem Spiel - nicht nur für Kaninchen!

Ariel,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 July 2018,5,"The hope we need for our nation all in this beautiful and charming book- a satire book staring a bowtie wearing gay bunny.Outside of the overt social messages here and the satire (for those that don't know the story, this is poking fun at Charlotte Pence's book about their pet bunny and shares a political message (and donated money) to organizations supporting LGBTQ+ communities)- but underneath all that is actually a really sweet and charming story about letting yourself love who you want to love, about acceptance, and about the love winning all.
"
Kyle,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 April 2018,5,"Wonderfully sweet and precious while simultaneously poignant and necessary in teaching young readers (and old) about open mindedness and acceptance.I purchased this book for a couple of reasons. 1. I love John Oliver and everything he and his team are doing at Last Week Tonight. 2. I fully support the Trevor Project, helping prevent suicidal LGBTQ, and AIDS United. 3. To stick it to the Pence's for their anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. I am happy to be a part of crushing their book; the only disappointment is that all this attention on this Marlon Bundo book likely gave a small boost, however slight, to the Pence's book, which probably wouldn't have sold much at all without the Last Week Tonight crew, because honestly, who give a damn about the VP's rabbit?I'm also curious about how the Pences feel about their bunny's namesake Marlon Brando turning out to be bisexual? That makes for some nice poetic justice.
"
Tony Alexander Møller,tates 🇺🇸 on 28 January 2022,5,"Where to start... I saw the book on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and had to get it, for multiple reasons. As many others did, I thought it was irresistibly funny that they would create a parody of the Pence Marlon Bundo book and use it to promote inclusivity, going against the anti-gay agenda of the Pence family. My toddlers love the book and the proceeds benefit a wonderful organization so everyone wins. It is also the only John Oliver humor I can expose my toddlers to, without having to worry about their language around other pre-K kids.It's great to see comedians like John Oliver using their platforms to bring positive social change and bring exposure to serious issues in our society. It's so rewarding to see that this book is in the #1 spot of most of the book charts and the ""other"" Marlon Bundo book didn't get close to the same reception.

Shannon M. Austin,une 2021,5,"Mike Pence as the Stinkbug.  Hysterical.  I have gifted many to new families.
"
Amazon Customer,March 2018,1,"This book is incredibly unrealistic. How would a stink bug even be in power in the first place? People would never vote for or follow someone like that, right? Also, I feel like the message that “different is okay” is weak. I mean, I feel like we already know that- even my 2 year old knows that. Doesn’t everyone already believe that “different is okay”? I just find it hard to believe any animal could possibly have an issue with that and also that anyone could support a character like the stink bug, so for that reason I have to give this book 1 star. Clearly this is a fictional book, and I don’t see that stated anywhere in the product description.I was going to buy several more as gifts for family and friends, but instead I’m going to just donate the cost of the books directly to the benefiting charities. In your face, Marlon!
"
Nivedita Nair, August 2020,5,"A beautifully illustrated, funny yet poignant story for all ages with an important message and values for our times! Diversity of all sorts is part of life, humanity and creation. We appreciate that some of the profits will go to benefit The Trevor Project and AIDS United. Not all of us Christians are V.P Pence-flavored Christians -- there's diversity among us, as well.  ""A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo"" feels like a well-conceived, creative form of expression of different world views and values in response to Pence's Bundo book and V.P. Pence's views and actions (not cool for someone who was elected to one of the highest public offices and called to serve for the welling of all voters and people, without bias or discrimination).  I love that V.P. Pence's daughter bought a copy of the book, too!
"
Kindle Customer,ingdom on 16 March 2022,5,"Let’s face it, Mike Pence’s rabbit is probably at least bi-curious. I mean why else would he have named it after Marlon Brando? I’ve had a male pet rabbit, and trust me, they’ll literally hump anything. In this book Marlon Bundo sets a good example, he doesn’t just go around humping indiscriminately, he waited for love and marriage. I thought Christians were always telling people to wait for marriage, so I’m surprised they don’t love this book.In any case this is a good bedtime book for my sons. I guess if you’re a bigot who wants to indoctrinate your children with the same hate that blackens your very heart and soul this book might not be for you. But I hope you accidentally order this instead of the other Marlon Bundo book.
"
Steffi , March 2018,5,"I have now officially purchased three copies of this book - and probably not my last! It's a great gift for anyone with kids, or frankly anyone with a heart. To be honest,  I didn't expect much of this book going in. Since it's a parody of the Pence book, I was a little bit worried that the authors were just going to ""phone it in.""  Fortunately for everyone involved, they absolutely did not! This is a very, very sweet book that I really enjoy, and I don't mind admitting how much I love the story despite my advanced age.  Love is love, friends support one another, and our differences are what make us beautiful. These are simple, true messages, no matter a person's politics. This book is for everyone. Enjoy!
"
Amazon Custobmercsy,tates on 19 March 2018,5,"This is the best book ever, if for no other reason than it probably irritates the right people! Aside from that, it's beautifully illustrated and a beautiful story that promotes tolerance, inclusion, and just letting people -- and rabbits -- live their lives. Don't be a dang stink bug!And for anyone wondering, it is actually written like a children's book -- there's nothing in it that should freak out or scare kids. In fact, I think it's a great way to bring up the discussion about homosexuality so that your child grows up understanding things instead of fearing them.
"
Henry,4 April 2018,5,"I bought this because my youngest child is having some issues connecting with her LGBTQ+ older sibling. They share the book, and it helps them find a great middle-ground and enjoy spending time with each other and teaches my youngest child that she can understand her older sibling's differences instead of treating it in the awful way the other kids at her elementary school do. A great quarantine buy for a family stuck together that helped take the edge off of the sibling battles.
"
Sarah M.,tates on 8 May 2020,5,"This book totally floored me with laughter. Aside from the fact that we are all ""sticking it to Pence"" by buying this version instead of his, this book is absolutely beautiful. The colourful drawings jump out of the page and one gets immersed in the story - but... it ends too quickly (a very happy ending, though)!I can't help but wonder whether the Pences actually know that their beloved bunny's name is most likely taken from Marlon Brando who, I believe, was gay?  That's certainly ironic! And hilariously funny to think Mike Pence is that dense...""Well, doggone it, Ma, I didn't know Marlon was a fruity-tutty, otherwise, I'd have named it Rock Hudson!""  Hee, hee, hee...

Gelegenheitsleser,tates on 19 May 2018,5,"How could my review possibly express how much my 2 year old loves this book? If we ever skip a day of reading it, she's definitely quoting it. Seriously, this book is a daily part of our lives for the past 6+ months. Fortunately, it's not at all annoying for adults, and I love that she's learning wholesome lessons about love, inclusivity, and voting. It's a winner all around!

The Romantic Rush Blog,tates on 29 May 2018,5,"I bought this book because the proceeds go to the Trevor Project and AIDS United, because I love giving children's books as gifts to children, because I love John Oliver, and yes, to stick a thumb in the eye of that stinkbug Mike Pence. What I didn't know was that this book would become my new favorite children's book, destined to become a classic up there with Where the Wild Things Are, Ferdinand, the Giant's Toe, and I Love You Forever. This book was ordered Sunday night at 11:30 pm and arrived to me on Tuesday. It is beautiful, sweet and witty and kids and their parents will love it. They are doing another printing as this book sold out in a day. Order yours ASAP. Thank you, John Oliver and company.

Timothy C.S. Bighead,tates on 3 March 2022,5,"I finally got my copy today after almost six weeks. I bought it because I love John Oliver and I wanted to support this project and send a message. I believe I accomplished all that.That being said, the book was DELIGHTFUL. I am not a sentimental person but I found myself tearing up a little when I read it. I don't know much about children or children's' books but this story was told in such a thoughtful and relatable way that I can only imagine parents and children finding this a great way to communicate that love is love.Thank you Jill Twiss and John Oliver and crew for putting out this lovely book. I continue to watch your show regularly and enjoy it.

G T G,tates on 4 May 2018,5,"It was a long wait to arrive, a month almost, but worth it: it is cute, irreverent of our current political climate, educational and compassionate of our diversity, all at the same time.  A bunny who just wants to be allowed to be what he is, without others telling him otherwise.  The fact that the sale benefits charity simply puts the icing on the cake of Doing the Right Thing and buying this version of little Marlon's story, versus the alternative story on sale from...other sources.A must buy for today's world!  Makes an excellent gift to friends, or young ones who could use the gift of understanding another's view of the world around them and how their acts can affect others.

Alicia,22 March 2018,1,"My family loves Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. We are always discussing the latest episodes over the phone or when we get to hang out. I bought these books as gifts for my brothers and they got a kick out of them. The message in this book is appropriate for any age. It explains things perfectly to children. The proceeds go to amazing non-profits so it is money well spent! The best bonus is that it’s a dig at a homophobic a-hole!!!
"
Nivedita Nair,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 March 2018,5,"This is a cute little tale of a boy bunny who finds his soulmate in another boy bunny.  The book was written by the political satire show, John Oliver's Last Week Tonight on HBO as an alternative to a similar book written by the staunchly anti LGBT Pences, with the profits going to LGBT causes.  The VP even makes an appearance in this book, probably not willingly, but I digress.  I bought this book for my soon-to-be great granddaughter that will be born into a family with openly gay members, who are loved and adored.  This will be her normal, a family where people are loved and accepted for who they are and are free to love who they love.

Kindle Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 28 July 2018,5,"Maybe it's a little heavy-handed with the vote, but if schoolhouse rock can teach us about getting bills made into laws, why can't a garden full of animals encourage change through voting? I worry about the power vacuum they've created by voting for, ""Not Stink Bug,"" but that's just the crazy adult in me.This really is a sweet book, was lovely illustrations, and I'll enjoy reading it to my son when he's old enough to stop teething on my tablet and listen along.If you embrace the fear of awkward conversations with your children, you might discover that a message about being able to be who you are and love who you love seems completely normal to them. No awkward conversation necessary.
"
R Boriack,tates 🇺🇸 on 18 July 2018,5,"It is seriously a cute book and the writing was better than I expected. I mostly got this book to piss off VP Pence, but this is a legit book for children and I found that it mostly addresses the somewhat complicated nature of marriage equality.My only drawback is that I thought it was a little to overly political. I felt that they could have written it a little more cleverly, but I probably should have expected that.Criticism aside, I still think this is a delightful book worth reading to any child. The story and artwork are outstanding considering how quickly they likely had to put this together.The proceeds also go to a great cause. Also, the book makes social conservatives heads explode which is well worth the purchase.
"
Nikos Rutkowski,tates 🇺🇸 on 6 September 2018,5,"This was such a cute book, I read it to my daughter and ended up crying at the end!A good choice for any parent that wants to raise their child in an LGBTQ+ inclusive environment.Definitely a good buy and would recommend!
"
Jennifer K. Gilman,tates 🇺🇸 on 5 May 2020,5,"Awe-inspiring, truth rattling, this book has it all. I have yet to come to a conclusion on what is better, the voice acting that is so conceivably believable that I actually had to look up if Jim Parsons is infact a homosexual rabbit, or the writing; it could also be the fact that this is all a middle finger to Pence, but who knows. No matter who you are, a Amish man, a girl from Montana, or a genderfluid demisexual from LA, you will be enchanted by the love depicted within the covers of this book. I only wish illiteracy had been vanquished just so no person has to forge on in life without giving this book a read. God bless the BOTUS!
"
Kdb,tates 🇺🇸 on 25 April 2019,5,"I sat in quiet while reading this book. I laughed out loud and I held back tears. I’m so happy this book was written you see I have an amazing daughter who is gay and has found the love of her life. They are engaged to be married (thank God it is still legal in my state). I have two other daughters who, when they got engaged to their male partners, my Mom told the world with excitement.  She hasn’t told a soul about my gay daughters engagement. So hopefully this book will teach the young whose minds haven’t been tainted that any one who finds love are the luckiest people in the world. And maybe teach a few others
"
Halee,tates 🇺🇸 on 13 October 2020,5,"What I like about this book is how poignant and to-the-point it is with its topics focusing on love and tolerance. It’s humor is enough to appeal to multitudes of audiences, but I would have loved to see this book be a little longer and see the bunnies try to plan on tackling of homophobia with regards to adoption.Whom would I recommend this book to? Anyone, especially young children because when they are so young, they still see the world with open hearts, open eyes and open minds.
"
Connie Gallant,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 March 2018,5,"I bought this about 5 minutes after John Oliver unveiled it on his show and it took a couple weeks to get it because, as John admitted on Seth Meyers' show, they had no idea so many people might actually buy it so they hadn't printed enough. Fine. I got my copy, read it immediately, and loved it. Then I ordered another copy for a friend's kid's birthday. It's now been on back order for almost a month and if it doesn't come soon, I'll miss the birthday. Are they simply not printing any more after that first surge of orders? Hard to tell but it's making me a little unhappy. Still, I gave it 4 stars because I did like it. I just deducted a star for slooooooow follow-up order fulfillment.
"
kendallreyn,tates 🇺🇸 on 2 May 2018,5,"Omigosh, how much fun is this magical little book! The story is adorable and written beautifully, and the illustrations really bring the tale to life. I highly recommend the audible version as a listen-along, as it's a mini-production itself, with recognizable talented voices. I only wish there was a song!My favorite thing about this book is that, while the *plot* centers on two boy bunnies falling in love, the ""moral"" or lesson is about how we have the power to change rules and leaders who no longer make sense, with our votes. Also, good friends are supportive of differences and cheer each other on. :)Well done, LWTWJO team, very well done, indeed!
"
Ali Anderson,tates 🇺🇸 on 13 May 2018,5,"The whole idea of people disagreeing with other people on this book.. if you watch the show John Oliver, he's not hating on the kids or what the vice president books about, hes hating on the vice president for being too anti-gay and other issues.. I personally am not gay, but i don't hate on people being gay either.. and i just love John Oliver Show, about the only reason i like HBO now days.. So when he had this topic on the show and how he hoped this would out sell his book, and the fact his books money supposedly goes to charity, I had to buy one too..
"
Elle B.,une 2021,5,"Maybe it was my new mom hormones but I literally cried after reading this for the first time. I bought it in support of the Trevor Project and to help beat Mrs. Pence's bunny book on the bestseller lists, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it's actually a very thoughtful and well written gem of a story. Now that I think of it, this is the only book in my 16 month old daughter's collection that depicts a same-sex relationship. Reading this book with your kids is a great way to encourage them to think of all loving relationships as wonderful and equal regardless of gender.
"
dinosnake,March 2018,1,"Yes, it took me less than five minutes to read it, and cost $12, but it is sweet, and silly, and has an AWESOME message, and the proceeds g9 to a great cause! Bunnies should marry whomever they want!
"
Nivedita Nair,tates on 1 November 2021,5,"I laughed convulsively when I heard well-known voice actors like Jim Parsons (Sheldon Cooper) read excerpts from this book — and I had to know how it ended. What could be better than supporting the Trevor Project, a crisis hotline for LGBTQ youth, while trolling Trump and Pence at the same time? It’s a very small price to pay for a very worthwhile cause - and the chastisement of two homophobes. I’d recommend the book to any progressive with a sense of humor, as well as for children of all ages who enjoy a whimsical, satiric love story written at The Kindergarten level.  It’s the perfect gift for the Easter Basket.

Marshall LaClair,tates on 25 May 2018,5,"As a former teacher who has probably read hundreds, if not thousands, of elementary children's books, I commend you for one of the best written, and beautifully illustrated books I've ever seen.  I thought this was going to be a thrown together story to make a political statement, but since I enjoy John Oliver every Sunday, I just decided to get it anyway.  It was the first grade teacher coming out in me.  BUT ... I actually laughed out loud (twice) and smiled throughout as it is a well thought out book.  Beautiful message, funny, colorful, and so on point.  Thank you for making my day!!
"
Kellygirl,tates on 1 April 2018,5,"This is a really cute children's book about two male bunnies who fall in love and want to get married. It's also a fun little political punch at certain political figures for adults to savor. It has a nice message about loving who you are, acceptance, and standing up for your friends.
"
Amazon Customer,tates on 29 April 2018,4,"I can only imagine had I read a book like this when I was young, just to let me know that being homogenous in a white evangelical christian society is not correct for everyone.  To let me know that I still had a place in the world.  Eventually, I did find knowledge, but it was a long journey.  This book can help kids understand that many types of people (races, cultures, ethnicities, religions and sexual orientation) walk this earth and are perfect in the eyes of their gods, and most importantly, themselves.Don't let the stinkbugs win.
"
R. Christakis,tates on 19 June 2021,5,"I purchased this after watching Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. It is a sweet story about a bunny who falls in love with another bunny who happens to be male. The drawings are lovely and the story sweet, a page turner! Please note: The book and its LGBT-inclusive theme was written by Jill Twiss (with Marlon Bundo credited as co-writer), who is a comedy writer for the television show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, aiming to denigrate Vice President Pence over his controversial anti-LGBT views, such as support for conversion therapy of gay adolescents and opposition to same-sex marriage. All profits from the book are being donated to The Trevor Project and AIDS United.
"
Anthony M.,tates on 3 April 2018,5,"Delightful!  I love how sweetly and innocently the book deals with affection and difference, so that a boy bunny wanted to be with a boy bunny is not the only type of difference there is.  Some people are angry that this was written with a partisan intent, and it did start out as a way to ""speak truth to power"" to Mike Pence, but it is not done in a hurtful way and is a wonderful affirmation of love.  And voting.  All of the proceeds to go charity, and even Mike Pence's daughter is supportive of it, especially since it is helping charity.
"
Nova Brazier,tates on 3 May 2018,5,"This is a beautifully illustrated, incredibly sweet story and it warms my heart to think children will be able to use it to better understand their LGBT friends and classmates or see their own experiences represented in a way that is loving and uplifting. It’s the kind of story I was sorely missing as a child, but I’m glad to have it now.I’m also very grateful to know that proceeds go to the Trevor Project, which provides outreach for LGBT youth in hostile or dangerous environments. I’ve nearly lost a couple of very close friends to attempted suicide due to homophobic harassment, so this charity is very dear to my heart.

Geek4Vocab,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 March 2018,5,"I loved this book. I bought it to support the Trevor Project and also as a form of protest against anti-LGBTQ+ efforts. I thought that Marlon and Wesley's love story was believable and had enough levity for a young audience. Their friends voted to oust a demagogue with hurtful and isolating ideas. Instead, they all realized that what makes them different form each other isn't meant to make them feel lonely, their differences can make them appreciate each other more. I think this is a wonderful book for young children and I hope to purchase the hardbook to save for when I have children in the future.
"
Nivedita Nair,tates 🇺🇸 on 8 June 2018,5,"I simply bought this book to support the effort and make another of John Oliver's crazy ideas successful. Was I ever impressed! It's utterly delightful! The story is darling and the illustrations are charming. I loved that it included more than just a story of a boy rabbit loving another boy rabbit. It encourages children who are a little bit different--maybe they eat their sandwiches crust first--to be who they are. It's message is both for the child who feels different AND the child's friends it encourages them to support friends in their differences. I can't say enough about how wonderful this book is!
"
Kindle Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 25 September 2018,5,"My three year old daughter loves the book, and while she isn't old enough to grasp all the content's deeper meaning she's a big fan of Marlon and likes the beautiful illustrations. We enjoy reading it and doing the voices for the many animals. I love the messages of acceptance and tolerance in this book. There's also the passive aggressive slights toward Mike Pence that give me a chuckle. Not a fan of his. I think it's a great read for kids and parents alike, especially if you want to teach your kids about accepting and loving others for who they are.

luckytroll,tates 🇺🇸 on 19 March 2018,5,"A literary classic to rival the Grapes of Wrath, the Color Purple, and Naked Lunch, Jill Twiss turns in fabulous work with A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo. This novel is sure to become a Nobel contender, perfectly capturing the Zeitgeist of the age we live in.Marlon Bundo and his very special friend Wesley are two new characters unlike any other. They're relationship unfolds over the course of twenty spectacular pages; their lives presented with Twiss's electric prose. I was incapable of putting this book down once I started, and look forward to whatever novel Twiss follows this with.

They both really enjoyed the book, after being together for 22 years it was awesome to see their reactions to a book like this and its positive reaffirming message. I also had my sister read this to my niece, it really is a wonderful kids book. The illustrations are amazing and the writing was great.

Lolabd48,tates 🇺🇸 on 11 July 2021,5,"This book is absolutely adorable with such important lessons in it about love, acceptance and standing up for what is right. Though this might be for children, as an adult I find that this is a book all ages should read since the message of love and acceptance gets lost along the way, as seen with the current state of things. I did not hesitate to purchase the book since I not only wanted to find out about Marlon Bundo and Wesley, but I love that all profits go to help charitable causes and that I can definitely stand behind. Thank you John Oliver for getting this amazing book out to us!!

PR Cannon,tates 🇺🇸 on 10 November 2020,5,"For all those parents who don't give a hoot about John Oliver and are just looking for a nice book to read to their kids, don't trust the 1 star reviews. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is a splendid, heart warming tale of love for ""every bunny who has felt different."" As an influence in your child's developing mind, this book normalizes the idea that everyone is different in their own way, and reminds kids that their voices matter. It is easy to see this book as one that would be revisited as one grows up, as its messages are applicable throughout a child's entire life.
"
Rhea and Dillon,tates 🇺🇸 on 25 December 2018,5,"Compared to notoriously homophobic Mike Pence's book, which is ostensibly for kids but was conceived by a family that believes in evangelical white heteronormativity and that being different from others is tantamount to being a filthy sinner, this delightful book brought to us by John Oliver of Last Week Tonight, with great writing by Jill Twist and hilarious illustrations from EG Keller, is a fantastic read for kids (heck, people) of any age and any orientation because of its universal messages of love and acceptance of differences. Buy it, donate to good causes such as the Trevor Project, and send a big FU to hate-filled stinkbugs like Mike Pence.
"
Mary F. Barcelos,ingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 November 2018,5,"We’ve had this book for little over a month now. At this point I must say “screw politics and everything associated with it” when it comes to this book. My 6-year old who has serious trouble putting words together is reading it voluntarily when nobody is in the room to see her read and compliment her... all I just now heard was a loud “you’re NOT in charge”.The story is cute and she loves it. She loves telling the stink bug off. It’s a perfect book for little kids who just realise they can assert their own authority. Well played!
"
NJ,une 2021,5,"The illegitimate VP's staff wrote a book about his rabbit, Marlon Bundo, and of course, it was a straight bunny marrying a girl bunny.  As boring as the famously intolerant and conversion therapy loving man himself.Enter John Oliver who's team wrote a MUCH better book about a gay bunny who marries a male bunny, and hilarity and some drama ensues.  Such a wonderful, book for children and adults to learn tolerance and love for others.  I highly recommend.  Plus, all book sales go to an LGBTQ anti-defamation charity.
"
landcruisers,March 2018,1,"So I, like maybe some others, just purchased this book to help John Oliver & Co. troll our homophobic VP. And, yeah, it felt pretty good to know that profits from the sales would be going to a couple of great charities in the meantime. What I didn’t expect, though, was how adorable and kinda beautiful this little book is. Just all on its own. It’s a sweet and simple little story that will be there to help all the little Marlon Bundos and Wesleys of the present and future know that they are not alone, And that different is special!M

Tyro’s mum,tates on 23 April 2018,5,"Encourages love for anyone different in a way the even children can understand. It also introduces how effective voting is to young children.I liked it, and I believe in the message it is conveying. I would love if the moral message was universal, but humanity is just not there yet. The majority of children that will see this book, will probably already grow up in an environment where the LGBT community is accepted.Still though, here is to hoping that this book also reaches children who do not live in a LGBT friendly environment.

Nivedita Nair,tates on 23 March 2018,5,"I received the book and before sending it to my young nephews read it.This book is well written, sweet, funny (I laughed out loud) and the message that different is ok is done with love.The idea of different is not just about being gay.  It teaches the lesson of tolerance; For kids who eat their crust first and other kid behaviors.  It teaches the idea that kids should be kind and support their friends.The characters have silly/funny names, the illustrations are great, and I just ordered two more books.Great job Jon Oliver.

Kindle Customer,tates on 15 July 2021,5,"This whole exercise is about poking fun at an ultra-conservative view point from an arrogant source. It is push-back against arrogant intolerance. It was also a fun purchase for someone who has all kinds of eclectic books in my library. I collect all kinds of off-beat books.

My husband then made me feel badly about it because Mike Pence's daughter wrote the book. She's not in our ridiculous and stupid government administration, however, so my husband felt it was wrong to make fun of a book she wrote just to get back at Mike Pence for being such far-right winger that he's out of touch with reality and humanity. Ah well. hilarious, nonetheless.

Sophie,tates on 21 March 2018,5,"A charming tale of two bunnies in love and how their friends helped them to overcome prejudice and hide-bound tradition. As you might expect from John Oliver, it takes an unmistakable progressive stance in favour of the underdog. Or you might say that it's a libtard screed against moral decency for the gay agenda, but if that is what you'd say, then you probably won't enjoy this book. Also, your children desperately need to read it!

Valerie,une 2021,5,"I've bought this book for many children in my life and it is definitely worth it. My 3-year-old niece has been canvassing with my sister asking her, ""Momma, did we vote? Momma, did we vote that stinkbug out?"" John Oliver should be proud of teaching the value and necessity of voting to the next generation. I believe that all Americans should vote because it makes us a stronger democracy and we should exercise the right and privilege that many people around the world do not have.

Jenna,March 2018,1,"Admittedly, we are huge John Oliver fans, so it is not a huge surprise that we purchased this book. What I was not expecting was the story to be told in such a way that my five year old completely understands that, of course, “boy bunnies can marry boy bunnies” and that being different is a positive quality. So well done, Marlon Bundo, Jill Twiss, and John Oliver. I really hope this is only the first of the adventures of Marlon and Wesley and the rest of the gang. We need more.

It's a beautiful story of love, acceptance and the fight against hatred. This book is very much needed in 2018. Throughout history, people have turned to the printed word for a glimmer of hope in the darkest of days. We are in such a moment in this period of human history. I am confident that A Day In The Life of Marlon Bundo will be viewed favorably with future generations as people used their freedom of speech to triumph hate with love.

Captain Hilts,tates on 27 April 2018,5,"Happy! Happy! Happy! Day for all bunnies, even a Senior Bunny like me! The big Stink Bugs who were in charge for a very long time would not allow any bunnies (even Senior Bunnies) to marry the bunny they loved IF they were different. Finally the most important bunnies in the world and who wear long black robes decreed (they said) that a bunny (even a Senior bunny) can marry whoever they love. This made the Big Stink Bugs unhappy, but made all bunnies (even Senior Bunnies like me) very happy happy happy! ☺
"
Jay Eisenhauer,tates on 22 October 2018,5,"Such a as cute book with such a great message!
"
H. Hanford,tates on 1 May 2018,5,"This is the antidote to Pence trying to make even more money by putting a book out about his bunny. This is the alternative, where the bunny falls in love with another male bunny and gets married. Several gay couples attend. The message is that you are you and that's ok, even if you're ""different"". Kid's book or a book for adults who want to counter Pence's agenda. Proceeds go to something LGBTQ related.
"
InfirmBookworm,4 June 2021,5,"Loved this book! Great way to make a complicated subject simple and easy to explain to my kids. When the book arrived in our book box, I had ZERO clue what it was about, but delighted in explaining the questions my kids had.  These talks are fun and necessary. Love bringing a broader perspective to my children being raised in an ordinary, straight family.
"
laura,22 March 2018,1,"I love this book! I bought it because it looked cute and might piss off Mike Pence. This is an amazing children’s book covering homosexuality without outright addressing it as being a “problem” because it’s not, it’s something that should be normalized, so this is a great first step
"
T. Ettel,tates 🇺🇸 on 22 April 2019,5,"What I said in the title.PS: also there's nothing “partisan” about this story. It's about accepting people who are different, and feeling OK about yourself being different, and also accepting people being gay, and being OK with yourself being gay. Which is only partisan to people who've decided they are against those things.It's also about love and friendship, and about the virtues of democracy (lower-case “d”), and not accepting the rule of tyrants. All of which might seem partisan to some, I guess, but not in America.
"
Nivedita Nair, 5 May 2019,5,"The book was cute and I think the language is perfect for an age group that's just hitting that age where you start to realize your sexuality (before your teens). I don't have children to read this to see how it'd go over with them but I do hope those who do have children share it with them instead of seeing it as just an adult thing. I eagerly await the day where the youth just shrug off homosexuality as a non-issue. Thanks, John, and everyone involved in making this book!
"
Kindle Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 March 2018,5,"a fine gift for any democratic family member.  purchased for my aunt in her 70's. She loves it and displays it on her coffee table. Also a nice gift for an LGBTQ family. Perfect for a school library and to add to your collection for when children visit.

Nicole ,tates 🇺🇸 on 7 May 2018,5,"I do not like Mr.Pence or what he stands for.While i am not gay but i do feel i have the right to oppose Mr. Pence and his sick actions against human beings.It is not any one""s right to judge others and that is why i bought this book.I hope it sends a message to all those who hate that there are humans in this country that support freedom of choice.The book is cute and i enjoyed it  screw you pence,trump.sorry i had to say it
"
M Penelope L,tates 🇺🇸 on 6 May 2018,5,"What a beautiful smart book. In addition to being a truly delightful thumb up the butt to Mike Pence's rampant homophobia, it is also a great story with a beautiful message of love and acceptance of friendship, community and civic responsibility. Beautiful illustrated and well told this is an absolute must read for kids of all ages. It is a genuine children's book, and one of the great ones. If more kids get their hand on books like this one maybe there is hope for humanity.
"
Jennifer Lewis, 13 June 2019,5,"This is definitely the better Bundo book.  My grandson listened to the whole book, actually the whole family listened to my first reading of the book.  At the end we said, ""Ahhh, love wins out"".  A feel good story about 2 bunnies in love.  The world needs more love and acceptance.  What a great world it would be if all the stinkbugs kept their nose out of other peoples lives.  The moral of the story is, don't be a stinkbug.
"
M. Turner,tates 🇺🇸 on 15 November 2018,5,"Purchased this adorable book wishing to contribute to the LGBTQ fundraiser. (Whom am I kidding?  I wanted the book to outsell Pence 10 to 1!)  Enjoyed the sweet story of innocent love and then donated the book to the local library.  I have the sneaking suspicion the librarian thought this was the similarly titled Pence book, but no matter!  It shall grace the shelves of our little town library and children will enjoy it as much as we did.
"
Amps,tates 🇺🇸 on 17 May 2018,5,"Really great book that both kids and adults can enjoy.  Everyone can get something out of it.  I bought it for my friend's 4 yo daughter and she liked it.
"
AD Burrows,4 June 2021,5,"The first time I read this through, I actually started crying. It may be thumbing the nose at certain politicians and a good clapback by a comedy/information show, but that doesn't change the fact that I adore this book and I hope actual kids read it so when/if they reach the age where they realize they're not het, they can remember reading about a boy bunny in love with another boy bunny and know that there is nothing wrong with them, they're just different.
"
ky,22 March 2018,1,"My granddaughter loved this book so much! She’s hoping for a sequel where Marlon and his husband adopt some kids! She thought but was great when Marlon’s friends stood up to the bureaucrat who would have kept Marlon from marrying. Great story with humor and a positive message.
"
AC,tates 🇺🇸 on 8 May 2018,5,"I grew up with two gay uncles and so it was always normal for me to understand that gender doesn't dictate who you love. I read this to my step-son (who obviously did not understand John Oliver's cheeky intentions) but he really did appreciate a new understanding of human/bunny relationships. ❤️
"
Nivedita Nair,tates 🇺🇸 on 6 October 2020,5,"There isn't much that my husband or I wouldn't buy if it was endorsed by John Oliver, let alone something he wrote. We immediately ordered this book for our son and I just read it to him. I loved it, not only does it talk about ""gay being ok"" but also anything different being ok (Mr. Paws being different was a complete lol). I also liked how the animals used a vote to make their voices heard.Love love love the illustrations and the messages.
"
Kindle Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 19 March 2018,5,"Está hecho con mucha dedicación, tanto la historia como las ilustraciones son muy monas. Soy muy fan de John Oliver y este libro es tal cual sale en su programa!
"
Ford Prefect,tates 🇺🇸 on 2 April 2018,5,"Obviously, the initial appeal of this book is that it is a love story between the pet bunny of Mike Pence and another boy bunny, which gives it some serious points. But it’s so much more than that. It is an adorably moving story that doesn’t solely rely on the fact that it is LGBT+, it shows the power of love and friendship and is a story that all children should hear.
"
Diane Novak,tates 🇺🇸 on 17 December 2019,5,"Finally received my copy today after it being on back order for weeks. So worth the wait! I hope this book ends up in every home and classroom across the country. Adults can appreciate the political nuances, but for children it is just a book about how we are all different in our individual ways. And there is nothing wrong with that. Acceptance and love are the most important emotions, and ultimately they will defeat the Stunk Bugs who struggles to suppress them. 😍😀💕
"
J. St Clair,tates 🇺🇸 on 29 January 2019,5,"We FINALLY got our book today! (It's been on backorder for a long time.) There's a good reason this has been sold out -- because it's AWESOME! My daughter and I read through it several times today -- she loves it too! Thanks, John Oliver for promoting this book, so that we'd know about it -- and thank you to the author and illustrator for making such a fun story! (Also, now I want a hedgehog, just so I can name him Dill Prickle.)
"
E. H.,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 April 2021,5,"This was absolutely adorable!!!! Oh my gosh, it was so cute, and such a sweet children's story. Honestly, if you're on the fence about buying this book because of the gay element - this story is more about being / feeling different and finding love and community and strong friendships than anything else. I bought a copy for my young nieces and nephews because it has all the values I would want to instill in my own children. The illustrations are also really beautiful!!
"
Steezy,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 March 2018,5,"This children’s book has an important message about diversity being key to our living and working together peacefully.  It’s sad a large portion of each generation has to unlearn discrimination- based on illogical ideas formed throughout our dark history.  My kids had to find out there are people in the world who choose not to accept others because of who they love and how they were born.  As teenagers now, they know it’s necessary to keep fighting for progress.  We’re not going backwards.
"
Steezy,tates 🇺🇸 on 16 October 2021,5,"If you hate Mike Pence, this is the book for you :)
"
Liam,tates 🇺🇸 on 26 August 2019,5,"One of the best kids books out there. My wife and I love the representation. Also the story behind why it was written is amazing and I highly suggest looking it up on youtube.
"
Strategic,4 June 2021,5,"This book was incredibly good. Sure it was 40 pages long and I only bought this because I love Last Week Tonight, but it excels as a kids book. The art is very charming and beautiful to look at, the characters are very fun, the humor is spot on, and the moral of the story is timeless. I would definitely say buy this for your kids, buy it because you love John Oliver, or just buy it because you know it would piss off Mike Pence. :)
"
G. Stewart,22 March 2018,1,"Okay, so as adults we're obviously buying this book for two reasons:A) To gently troll a famous and influential homophobe&B) To donate money to some very important LGBTQ+ causes.However, as a teacher who has read my fair share of children's books this is a VERY well done book! The story is straightforward and heartwarming with elements for both children and adults to enjoy. At the end of the day it gives a message that it is OKAY to he different. A+
"
Rue Kennedy,tates 🇺🇸 on 17 December 2019,5,"Bought both the audiobook and hardbound — the first for the delightful readings by a stellar cast, the second for the cute illustrations and to be able to share it. Some of the illustrations are a bit scary — they brought back memories of a 6-year-old me ducking under the theater seat in front of me when the Wicked Queen in ""Sleeping Beauty"" sprang on the screen. But all in all, a fun little book with an important message that should be shared!
"
monikerlewinsky,tates 🇺🇸 on 2 July 2020,5,"I don't know that I really need to write a review but I felt that this book deserved another five stars. This book deserves all of the stars.As I watched the episode of Jon Oliver that advertised this book, I was overcome with joy and tears. This book is for every man, woman, child, adult, teenager who has ever felt alone or unworthy of love in this world.I cannot wait to read this book to my future children.
"
Nivedita Nair,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 March 2018,5,"This is the absolute best book for all ages. Beautiful message! This should be a gift for every one you know.

Kindle Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 March 2018,5,"I have not read the book.  I probably won't read it but I was happy to spend the money since John Oliver is donating all the proceeds to The Trevor Project and an AIDS charity.  If it does nothing except overshadow the book by the vice president's wife and daughter it was worth my money.I proudly display the book for all my friends to see and know that I support this version and not the other of the similar tale.
"
Cristin,tates 🇺🇸 on 13 July 2020,5,"I cannot say enough about how much I love this! It is so cute and I plan on reading it to all my nieces and nephews. It really is a story about acceptance of the differences that make us special while also reminding us that if people aren't representing what we believe we can make a change for what is right. A good story for anyone that wants to make a difference, also a wonderful way to explain different relationships to children.
"
Caitlin,tates 🇺🇸 on 10 August 2021,5,"For a children's book written for an adult late night show, this book is very poignant. The message it presents - different is GOOD - is a message that, unfortunately, many in the U.S. don't quite understand. We should absolutely teach our children that our differences are what make us strong, and I am going to do my part in that by putting this book in my classroom's library. Even if it only impacts a single student, it will be worth it.
"
Amazon Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 16 August 2021,5,"This the best! Tells a wonderful story about acceptance and I bought it for my niece. I also love that proceeds are donated to charity. So glad books like this are written today to teach a whole new generation about the importance of love and acceptance. Highly recommend!!
"
Ayamuri,tates 🇺🇸 on 17 April 2018,5,"This book has a great storyline about Marlon Bundo, the Vice President's bunny. Bundo falls in love with another boy bunny and gets married. (This is, of course, in direct contradiction to the VPs actual stance on gay marriage). It is worth mentioning that 100% of the proceeds from this book go to the Trevor Project and AIDS United. Also, Pence's book on Bundo comes out the day after this one, so buying this book is a great way to give him a big middle finger!
"
Brandon Review,tates 🇺🇸 on 21 June 2018,5,"Great book. My wife and I enjoyed it, as well as our niece and nephew. The art is bright and cheery, and the story has a great message about inclusiveness and acceptance of others and their differences. It's a message we should all remember and try hard in our life to enact. Feels good that all proceeds are going to support LGBTQ suicide prevention.Oh yeah, Mike Pence is an awful, small minded, bigoted troll of a person, and anything that can help him fail in life, and not achieve his evil, disgusting goals, is worth my money, time and effort. Buy this book.
"
NAS,tates 🇺🇸 on 17 June 2018,5,"Hate that giving this a five star means fewer haters and homophobes will read this review, but I also don't want to push the overall rating too far down.Love the book, love the concept, love that the profits are going to the Trevor Project.  💜 One of my only impulse purchases on Amazon that I would make again!Thank you, Last Week Tonight and John Oliver for making this book!
"
Nick Pregent,une 2021,5,"My husband and I bought 2 books. One for us and one for our nieces.  I love how cute the story is and how the stinkbug gets what he deserves in the end.
"
Leslie Hulkower,March 2018,1,"When I heard about this book I knew I had to get a few for my friends and family. This is especially awesome now that Mrs Pence has taken a job at a place where love is love is not taught. The illustrations are fantastic and the fact proceeds go to charity make it an even better purchase. Anything that promotes more peace and love in the world deserves a spot on my shelf.
"
Lisa Marie Hyslop,tates on 1 July 2018,5,"My friend's Ruby the cat and Ranger the dog asked to write this review. Some cats hate dogs. Some dogs hate cats. Some learn to work out their differences. When this book arrived Ruby and Ranger both wanted to be the first to hear it. We compromised. My 12 year old read the book outloud to them while they behaved. After the laughter they chased each other a bit but hey that's just one way for cats and dogs to live.
"
Diane K.,tates on 19 December 2020,5,"This book illustrates the world many of us wish to live in. A world where true equality means being yourself no matter who you are. This book is a small step in the right direction, but just might make a big difference in true acceptance. I will be reading this to my kids so they never have to know a world where they feel shame. I can't wait for the day this nonsense is all history.
"
Nivedita Nair,tates on 4 June 2018,5,"This is an incredible story of a little boy bunny overcoming a stink bug who thinks it's wrong to marry a boy bunny. It also happens to be a wonderful story about how people can come together to fight against discrimination and bigotry.The voice acting for the Audible version is great. Amazing quality for a children's book.I'd recommend every child read this book. It's a story all children need to hear so they don't grow up to be stink bugs.
"
Kindle Customer,tates on 25 May 2020,5,"This book is read to my very young child constantly. The message is very clear to create and share a loving environment with everyone, and this book takes a thoughtful approach in teaching children that some people think they know what’s right, when in reality, they’re opinions are just that: Opinions. I can’t wait for my child to read this to me and understand the core message that love is genderless.
"
"Beth G, An Opinionated Shopper", February 2020,5,"The book is beautifully written and illustrated and a joy to read and look at for children and adults of all ages. The message behind the story deserves to be heard and this book is wonderful at teaching it to children in a soft and appropriate way. It is worth every cent you pay for it and the fact that the proceeds go to organizations like the Trevor Project, ultimately helping LGBT+ youth, makes it even better. Definitely a great choice for open-minded parents looking for a way to normalize LGBT+ topics for their children.
"
LouieJ,tates on 24 April 2018,5,"Marlon Bundo, is the best bunny ever. Despite the fact that John Olliver and Last Week Tonight published this book as a practical joke, I really enjoy the refreshing nature of this story. A proper story for kids to read in 2018 about love, friendship, compassion, and where the villains who always win in the real world are defeated by the power of common sense. If both of your friends love each other very much, they deserve their own happy ending.
"
TR,January 2021,5,"I'm so glad I got this book for my girls (7 & 9yrs).  We first saw it on Last Week Tonight & my husband and I knew we were going to support The Trevor Project.  We also wanted to support the LWT Team, so we bought it in hardcopy, the kindle and the audible version, because I wanted to hear Jim Parsons' narration. All versions are excellent, and I'm proud to own a copy! It teaches tolerance and celebrates love. Get it today!

Joan Fregapane,tates on 25 July 2019,5,"I bought this for a soon to be niece/nephew.  I had to read it before gifting.  My partner read it to me.  I recommend letting someone with a thick French accent read this story to you.  It is soooo cute and memorable.

~blobyn~,tates on 9 May 2018,5,"What a sweet children's story.  I actually bought this just to support the cause, but I was pleasantly surprised by the story.  It is actually a very well-written children's book and the message is perfectly tuned and age appropriate.  The characters and illustrations are fun and my two boys 6 and 3 were super engaged and my oldest asked a lot of good questions.  What a sweet story and perfect way to teach a very nice lesson.

~blobyn~,tates on 4 May 2018,5,"Ich kann dieses Kinderbuch nur weiterempfehlen! Ich habe es bereits mehrmals verschenkt und benutze es in meinem muslimischen Heimatland, um Kindern in der Familie und Nachbarschaft die Akzeptanz des 'Andersseins' näherzubringen. Zumal mein Bruder dort mit dem 'Anderssein' zu kämpfen hat! Mein Herz macht jedes Mal einen Sprung wenn ein Kind zu mir kommt und sagt: Tante, du gehörst zu Onkel x, Onkel x gehört zu Onkel x und Marlon gehört zu Wesley (das homosexuelle Hasenpärchen aus dem Buch)! Die Zeichnungen sind dazu noch sehr schön gemacht! Ich danke dem Last Week Tonight Team für dieses wundervolle Kinderbuch!

Kmac,4 June 2021,5,"I ordered this book the night that John Oliver promoted it on his show, and had to wait a month to receive it. The wait was worth it. The story is adorable, the illustrations are beautiful, and it’s such a heartwarming, wonderful message of inclusion for children, while also having some subtle humor for the adults. Highly recommend for anyone that enjoys a book with a positive message. The fact that the proceeds are supporting wonderful charities makes it even better.

Satire for adults but written in a loving manner for children ... who hopefully will grow up in a brighter world where all people care about those who are different from themselves. As adults they can learn about the satire and look back in wonder about how Colbert and so many others kept hope alive during a sorrowful time of hate and ignorance coming from the nation's political leaders.

Amazon Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 24 March 2018,5,"I bought this book after watching John Oliver's episode on Mike Pence and thought 'why not, it'll piss someone off who really should just piss off'. But the more I read it, the more I realized that more books like this should probably exist. I'm glad I bought the book and if I can help someone else find the acceptance that I have, then I'll gladly do my part.Also Marlon Bundo is adorable in a bow tie, can we all agree on that?

stacytr,tates 🇺🇸 on 14 September 2021,5,"Great book, going to buy another copy because my son spilled milk all over it, and of course he didn’t clean it all up because he’s a lazy ass teenager, so all of the pages are stuck together like some pubescent boys playboy that’s stuffed between his mattress and box spring in the hope’s that his Mother will never find it because it will crush her image of the innocent little boy he no longer is.

I love John Oliver, and this is a great satire, but I spent over an hour troubleshooting before I called AMAZON support, and got the answer immediately. They told me there should have been a disclaimer, but when I checked back, there was none. Fortunately, I have a Kindle and a Fire so I can read the book, otherwise I would have asked for a refund.

Kim C,tates 🇺🇸 on 25 April 2018,5,"To me this is a collectible! That politician with his rabbit he takes everywhere just kills me. He is anti-gay, doesn't believe in helping the little guy and more. Instead of writing a children's book about his bunny he should of been taking Deversity classes. So talk show host John Oliver wrote this version about 2 gay Bunny's getting married. John Oliver has more sales then that ridiculous politician. Enjoy John Oliver's version

Sometimes it's about the message but this sweet children's story is about the effect of the message.Numbers don't lie. The same can't always be said people who have the public's eye. If this message of tolerance and love between and amongst people who are different or the same strikes a chord in your soul, buy this book.

Lindsay ,tates on 6 May 2018,5,"Marlon Bundo had a great day. And because I bought his book, so did I.My only complaint is that bunny footprints don't look like the ones in the illustration. But I'll let illustrator EG Keller have the benefit of the doubt in the artistic license department. The other illustrations are perfect. Marlon's co-author, Jill Twiss, did a superb job of keeping Marlon cranking out the story.No spoilers here, but rest assured, Marlon's day is a wonderful one.

For heaven's sake, really, there's not enough love in the world as it is!!!!Love whomever you want.  I'm fine getting humorous digs in at divisive haters.  Whether you support the politics or not, at least acknowledge their use of fear-based,  facist tactics.
"
Kindle Customer, March 2018,5,"We need more books like this. Books that normalize what is normal (being gay is not abnormal) really do help to remove fear and shame about being ""a little different"". We are all a little different, and that is okay, because we are also all the same. I read this book aloud to my kids immediately after it was delivered, and it was a joy. I laughed at a few parts and really enjoyed the cute simple story.

I don't have young children and have no plans to have any in my home for another six to eight years at least, but I knew I had to have this book on hand. There are subtle points for adults and inclusive, basic niceness for the little ones. It's a win all around.

Alexis,tates on 19 October 2020,5,"Cute story for kids (positive messages like differences are to be celebrated, love is love, and the importance of voting) and subtle political jokes for adults. Doesn’t hammer you over the head with it’s message. Well done to John Oliver and the LWT team!

Oogie,tates on 3 November 2018,5,"I should know, I published a successful book (in part) as a protest against the Communications Decency Act of 1996, to put something in the Library of Congress dedicated to Senator Exon (the bill's sponsor). Such a protest is only effective if the book stands on it's own as wonderful literature you'd enjoy reading and sharing otherwise. Few books have as much appeal to children and adults while delivering such a beautiful message.

I would be lying if I said it didn’t bring tears to my husband’s eyes as we finished reading it to our 4 and 2.5 year old. My 4 year old, as we finished, proudly shouted “I HATE STINK BUGS! EW!”Ew is right, my dear. Don’t ever change.“Stink Bugs are temporary, Love is forever”.

Bob Reilly,n 1 April 2019,5,"I primarily purchased this book because I really like John Oliver's show and think the charity benefiting from the proceeds is worthwhile. Then I got the book and read it. The story is fun with a bit of sharp satire thrown in. The illustrations are beautiful and were far better than what I was expecting from what could be considered a spoof book. This is a very high quality peice of work and a great story!

Kindle Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 21 March 2018,5,"The story is nice, but the illustrations are perfect for the characters and full of winning charm to make this story lovable, despite the controversial subject matter (for conservatives).A quick read and great way to discuss LGBT issues with youngsters.

Lane Sawyer, 16 March 2020,5,"This book is great, sweet, and funny.  This is just a great story made even better when you know why it exists.  The message of love and acceptance is so sweet. The illustrations are beautiful. This is a great book for anyone who has ever felt different (and who hasn't). Kids and parents will love this book and the wonderful message that let's them know that it is okay to be different because that is what makes us unique.
"
K.Suto,tates 🇺🇸 on 24 April 2018,5,"It is pretty funny and a sweet story. This must have been very rushed or they intentionally didn’t care much about the grammar. Since this was a gift for a child, I would have preferred more care to punctuation which I know seems silly considering the book but the child is learning. Otherwise, it is a good story that also encourages voting. The reviews on back were also the best reviews I’ve ever read.

Nadine Weber,n 19 February 2019,5,"As the mother of a gay son who remembers the discrimination he suffered in his youth, I am happy this charming book is available now. If, through my purchase, I am also contributing support for gay rights while competing with the sales of that other book, I am even happier. Love is something to celebrate, not demonize.

Because everyone IS different...and Because that is what friends do! After all, We are all walking this planet together.
"
Brandy Griffin,tates 🇺🇸 on 25 January 2021,5,"This was utterly gorgeous. I am so very grateful for John Oliver to have brought this book to my attention. May God bless the cause. This is an amazing way to get word across and tell off Pence for his ways and even create something wonderful for the children to enjoy as well. The audio is very much worth the extra price. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and am so enthusiastic to see how many others are as well! ❤🙏
"
Emily Friesen,4 June 2021,5,"I loved this book. The puns, both subtle and blatant, had me laughing all the way through the book. While intended to be pure, hilarious, biting, anti-Pence satire (the stink bug even looked a bit like Pence), it was still a very nice children's short story that taught love and acceptance of others who are different from ourselves. This should be required reading for all children and their parents along with Leslea Newman's ""Heather Has Two Mommies"".
"
Afl2018,22 March 2018,1,"So I got this book because I am huge john oliver fan. Little did I know the gem that I had just gotten for my child.She is 5 and she loves this book! It isn’t horrible and boring like most childrens books. It has beautiful pictures and the message isn’t just gay is okay but being different is okay. Great message for kids and very cute story. Can’t wait to buy more for gifts!
"
Angela,tates 🇺🇸 on 18 April 2019,5,"having watched much of last week tonight with John Oliver, I bought this book believing it to just be political comedy hidden in a children's book. Although the book certainly uses a little political comedy, that is clearly overshadowed by the positive message of differences in people.The use of bright colours and positive message makes this one of the must-have children's books In our modern age
"
Megan M,tates 🇺🇸 on 19 March 2018,5,"Great book and great message! Love is love no matter who you are. I just received it yesterday and read it immediately to my 8 yr old son, who after a few times asking for clarification who was the girl bunny and who was the boy bunny, I said no they’re both boys... “Ohhhhh, now I get it” and then he was cool with it. Kids are so tolerant if you let them be. “Love is forever!!”
"
Kathy L,tates 🇺🇸 on 25 September 2018,5,"I loved this book & hopefully it'll be passed down from my grandkids, to their kids, & so on. I feel that every child feel different at one time or another in their life. This book tells them that not only is it ok to be different, but also that everyone is. It is a great book for all ages. There isn't anything in this book that I find offensive & recommend it for teachers.
"
Nivedita Nair,tates 🇺🇸 on 9 August 2018,5,"I LOVE John Oliver. This book is well written. I thought the story would s*ck because it was only made to mock vice president Pence. I was wrong!

"
Kindle Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 22 March 2020,5,"Pretty accurate description of what is going on at the current moment with the stinky bug in charge of the US. I HIGHLY recommend it to all your republican friends that just don't quite get what is truly going on in the white house.

Alan T Houck,tates 🇺🇸 on 22 March 2018,5,"I got this for my best friend's granddaughter for her birthday.

I hope when she is a little older she will sympathize with Marlon Bundo and his true love!

Lance Cormier,tates 🇺🇸 on 26 November 2018,5,"A brilliantly conceived and written tale all children and adults should read, learn from and enjoy.  Compassion, tolerance and acceptance are the true cornerstones of the melting pot called America, and without nurturing those traits we can never transcend to the next level of cultural evolution as a species.The graphics are well done, and the story told in a way that even adults find sweet and endearing.  A must read for all!

Lisa 48640,tates 🇺🇸 on 28 February 2020,5,"It is extremely well written, with the cutest Illustrations! I love it and I am sure, that every child will love it too. The story is heartwarming. To be honest, I didn't expect it to be that cute, because it was promoted by John Olivers Last Week Tonight, which is a Late Night Show for adults. I had to wait for a few months, because it wasn't in stock. But it was definetely worth the wait! Although it's a little bit sad that I can't read it to the children as l am living in a non-english-speaking country.
"
Frank Garabo,4 June 2021,5,"As a 40-something person who shares a house with two rabbits and believes that people should be allowed to live their own lives, I was looking forward to this book. I figured it would be funny--but I did not expect it to be so touching. I had tears in my eyes as I finished the book. This is a children's book, but it's great for adults as well. I can't recommend this book strongly enough!
"
Frank Garabo,22 March 2018,1,"I'm an early childhood educator, and I read a lot of children's books. I bought this to support the good cause, and to piss off Mike Pence in whatever small way I can. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually very well written, age appropriate, and totally adorable. It's a tad long for my 21 month old, but she attended for most of it, and I'm sure she will love it as she grows.
"
JMF,tates 🇺🇸 on 5 January 2021,5,"I’m such a huge fan of Last Week Tonight, and I couldn’t resist buying this. It is so adorable! And it’s a great, cute way to introduce same-sex couples to your children!
"
Serg,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 March 2018,5,"It’s almost absurd how much joy this book brings me!  There isn’t any overt Trump bashing, outside of a very hateful bug that is voted out in the story. Outside of that it’s just a cute bunny story, with a great message! you can genuinely read this it children, without any political issues. Only the adults are going to pick up on the underlying story taking place.
"
Barbie, 15 June 2020,5,"Such a wonderfully sweet book. Fantastic message about love, friendship, and acceptance. Also a very good message about the ability to not just stand up to the bullies, but to strip their power of we all come together. I absolutely cannot wait to share this with my daughter (6). We all have different things about us and this book has the positive message of celebrating those differences in the face of (sometimes cruel) adversity.

I enjoyed where they showed that everyone is different and that being different is not bad. I believe that children innately feel this way and this book reinforces how to live in peace and harmony with others.  Maybe if more adults stopped worrying about controlling what everyone else does or believes, we could get along much better.

I told her that I wish I could have given her an equal world to live in, but that there are many people working daily toward that goal. She is reading the book today at her LGBTQ club at school. Thank you John Oliver for fighting this fight and standing up against intolerance. We love Bundo!!!

The story about supporting each others individuality is so sweet and uplifting, the illustrations are vibrant and expressive. I'm just glad my kids have it!

Pablo Nobre,une 2021,5,"Intolerance and unacceptance are 'taught'. These are not inherently present in children. This book has such a wonderful message for adults and children alike. I will definitely be reading this book to my kids. It doesnt take much to accept someone, and this book delivers the meaning in the most delightful way possible. Congratulations to John Oliver and Last Week Tonight on this monumental middle finger to people like Mike Pence.

It opens up the conversation about the different types of love and different types of families out there while being age appropriate, as well as the importance of getting out to vote.

Amazon Customer,tates on 20 October 2021,5,"Powerful and playful lesson in the power of LOVE and the strength of DIVERSITY and INCLUSION. It also reminds us that we can CHOOSE our leaders with the power of our VOTE. Don't let the stink bugs tell you who you can and cannot love; who you can and cannot be.

A West,March 2018,1,"A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is a wonderful book that adults can actually enjoy reading aloud to children. It may be true Marlon Bundo is a nontraditional rabbit, but it is also true today's children are nontraditional in their life experiences.  Children learn that being different in one way does not marginalize them.  It should be in the children's section of every library.

But I believe that because they were trying to satisfy an avalanche of demand so quickly, the publisher went the cheap route in printing.  My book smells awful.  The only way I can describe it is it smells like a paper mill.  Well if you've ever been around a paper mill you know exactly the smell I am talking about; think dirty sweaty socks, a hint of jockstrap, undertones of decomposing pencils with a heap of sharp toxic glue. Also, the book arrived in plastic shrink wrap, so I tried to ""air it out"" which has not seemed to be successful.  I am actually sad to send it back because I liked the book.

The story is very cute and appropriate for all ages, about love (innocent love) and how love can come in any shape. The illustrations are gorgeous, easily my favorite part of the book.

anataraj,tates 🇺🇸 on 3 May 2018,5,"Love, love, love the book. Independent of one's admiration for the late show host, it's objectively a really cute children's book.

Sequel idea animals protest company pollution of their garden. Marlon Bundo travels with the VP and unbeknownst to the VP unites those who are affected by policy changes of the administration. I'll buy all additional books produced.

I would have baked a carrot cake.

Ken Gross,une 2021,5,"Reminds the wife and I that the country needs to be inclusive of all. Well written and illustrated. Only regret is we own a digital copy and feel sad to not have responded early enough for a hard copy. Big reason for purchase however was the donation to all the great supporters of rights for all.

Spread love by spreading this book! <3

Hayden Phillips,tates on 22 April 2018,5,"Someday this will sit on tiny shelves across the land.  Being a kid is confusing enough. This is a wonderful tale to help our children understand that everyone is different and that should always be okay.  I say ""Good Job"" to everyone involved in this worthy project.  A must read for every parent to every child.  AAA+++
"
Kindle Customer,tates on 23 May 2018,5,"This is clearly one of those children's books that will be enjoyed by adults as well.  Kudos to Jim Parsons for bringing us the voice of Malon Bundo, and to the other wonderful actors who put in their time and talents for the book.  I highly recommend this book over the other one.

Andrea Foy,tates on 18 April 2020,5,"I bought it fit my niece and she loves it. The story is lovely, the drawings are adorable and it has the added benefit of supporting great causes. Obviously my niece doesn’t understand that (she is a toddler) but she does love when my sister reads the story to her. She’s always asking for her “Malo Muno” book
"
Kathleen Miller,tates on 20 July 2018,5,"What a fun book! If you can't love bunnies who love other bunnies, and if your friends aren't the ones helping you with Big Decisions, and if you can't be different and still loved, then everything has gone wrong. The drawings are adorable, and the hedgehog is adorable.
"
Jenny J,tates on 7 April 2019,5,"A delightful book that's fun and beautifully illustrated, with a good age-appropriate message of acceptance and love.  John Oliver is one of the comedy geniuses of our time!  Also, it makes me smile that this hopefully sticks in the craw of the homophobic jerk who inspired it in the first place.
"
Laura P,tates on 4 June 2018,5,"Bought it to help add a stick in Mike Pence's  craw, but I adore this book. It reinforces that love and respect are the most important qualities to have in life and relationships. If we could all have these qualities, the world would be an amazing place. Respect all the colors of the rainbow!

Matty,22 March 2018,1,"I purchased this for a good cause and to stick it to homophobes. I had no desire to know what it was about story wise. I'm a fan of John Oliver, he wrote a petty book in response to a REAL book, so I was sold!
"
)O(  TarotFan,tates 🇺🇸 on 6 May 2018,5,"A wonderful story that goes far beyond any political intent. It is a heartwarming story of love and learning to love ourselves - whoever we turn out to be.

"
Amazon Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 October 2019,5,"I bought this book because I couldn’t stop laughing at John Oliver during his segment about it. It came to be after a short wait and was like Christmas morning. Don’t have children yet but when I do they will be getting this read to them. Yes pokes fun at Pence but it a sweet story of love.
"
Amazon Customer,tates 🇺🇸 on 4 May 2018,5,"Loved reading this to my 5 year old daughter. We both giggled and smiled throughout, albeit for very different reasons. So clever with a sweet message. My favorite thing was that she asked at the end if the boy bunnies could adopt a squirrel baby, so I know the message of love wasn’t lost on her. Well done.
"
Ericka,tates 🇺🇸 on 21 March 2018,5,"It's light, joyful, and funny!  A tender story of two bunnies who enjoy life on their own terms.  If you are struggling to approach the topic of same sex couples with a young person, or old, this book may be just what you need!  I loved it.

Karen Banik,tates 🇺🇸 on 20 December 2018,5,"Absolutely hands down one of the best children’s books I’ve read in a long time. The message is amazing and your money goes to help LGBT kids in need.

"
Jillian Duke,tates 🇺🇸 on 23 March 2018,5,"Bought it for my under 1 year old granddaughter.  Straight but I don't hate. Hearts, not parts. The concept is normal if you are, and twisted if you are.

I love how it deals with the topic and I sensitive and commonsense way. Thanks!
"
Nivedita Nair,tates 🇺🇸 on 30 April 2018,5,"While adults may find this book to be political, children won’t take it that way. I’m assuming those saying it’s inappropriate for kids haven’t actually read it. The themes of this book are: 1) there is nothing wrong with being different, and 2) if you disagree with your leaders, vote to change them. My kids enjoyed it.

Amy,tates on 23 March 2018,5,"Great little story.  Got this for my first granddaughter.  It’s her first book and she seemed to like it.  I am determined she’ll not be raised with hate and predjudice just because someone is different, i.e. color of their skin, race, or orientation.  Great place to start.

J &K Hopkins,une 2021,5,"This is one of the sweetest children's books I have ever read.

Nicholas Williams,May 2018,5,"I am not a child nor do I have children. I bought this book to support the charities mentioned on the Ellen show. I read the book and like that there is a very positive message for children. As a bonus I love that it is out-selling the book by Karen Pence.

ShoesNBlues,4 June 2021,5,"It's a cute book. Admittedly, I purchased it mostly as a political statement and knowing that the profits are going to charity.  If you get the Kindle edition and spring for the extra $2 for narration you'll get to have Jim Parsons (Sheldon, Big Bang Theory) read the book to you.

"
Sarah Green,tates 🇺🇸 on 24 January 2019,5,"This charming book helps to humanize people who are (or will not be) not like most of its readers. Like any good story, it stops short of being transcendental - humanizing the ""bad guys"" as well as the ""good guys"", but hell, not even the Bible does that!
"
Specialk421a,tates 🇺🇸 on 11 September 2020,5,"What a great story!  A message for all ages about love and friendship and recognizing an individual's right to choose.  It was wonderful when the animals rose up and told the stink bug that he was not in charge and could not dictate their feelings.

Kayte,22 March 2018,1,"I love this book.  The illustrations are beautifully done.  The story is a simple one.  Lonely bunny meets another bunny and they become friends.  The setting is the White House, but politics aside, it's a lovely little story perfect for toddler age and beyond.

Hakasims,tates 🇺🇸 on 11 September 2018,5,"Such a great book and such a great idea to annoy the Vice President while introducing children to a likable gay character and show that being gay is normal and gay marriage is A-OK as well.

J. Holmansky,tates on 20 March 2018,5,"This is a story about friendship, love, and empowerment that all children should hear from the very beginning.  I just read it to my unborn baby girl, who is loved unconditionally.  May she grow up in a world free to choose love, regardless of gender.

"
J. Moore,tates on 14 March 2019,5,"Hilarious! I was worried that it might not be the most child appropriate and be more for me than my son, but this is something I can definitely read to him. Yes, a lot of the humor will go over his head - but that’s ok.
"
G C,tates on 14 May 2018,5,"There are so many creative and multilayered components to this ... so thoughtful and supportive for not just the community it seeks to uplift, but also to reach out to those who don’t understand.  Bravo, and thanks to the souls that made it happen.

eeezeee,tates on 6 April 2018,5,"This could be the worst book ever written and I would still buy it and give it a great review just to support some great charities and annoy some ignorant and hurtful Trump/Pence supporters.  Happily, it's a great children's book with a powerful message!  Money well spent.
"
Thom,tates on 19 March 2018,5,"What a great kids book and for adults.  The illustrations are priceless.  Will be right up there with all political satire, like Doonesbury, when this era is over (hopefully) some day.  Reminds us of values about humanity and equality
"
David G. Fuller Jr.,tates on 11 August 2018,5,"What started as a parody with John Oliver may turn out to be a classic. Good lessons here - for children AND adults.

Sierra,22 March 2018,1,"I was looking for a nice book to get my son for his birthday that would be positive and teach tolerance and acceptance. So I was really excited when I ordered this book because it looked so darn cute!  But I was incredibly disappointed because while I’m not a fan of mike pence or trump by any stretch of the imagination, it just really didn’t fit into a book I want to read to my 4 year old child. I feel like it was a political book using acceptance and tolerance as the “theme”. Again, I’m not at all a supporter of mike pence and trump, but it’s not something I feel is appropriate to discuss with my preschooler. I will be more cautious next time I buy a children’s book on amazon! The description should be more transparent about what is inside the book.

I was hoping it would be educational; instead, it seems it's just for ripping on trump and pence. I was hoping for a true, educational, exciting children's book that has gay characters. The sole instruction of this book, however, is to spite the 45th (and crew). Is it too much to ask for children's books that are educational and happen to have diversity?
